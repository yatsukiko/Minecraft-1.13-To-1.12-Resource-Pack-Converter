# Minecraft-1.13-To-1.12-Resource-Pack-Converter
all of these scipts basically just renames files or folders and edits names inside .jsons, I am probably missing changes for jsons in **minecraft/models/items** if it exits but I didn't have a resource pack to check so

### To run this thing: 
- **one.** Requirements, just install python3, any afaik
- **two.** Put all the files in root of your resouce pack (where your assets folder is) then run all.py, idk does it matter but i always kept doing it with powershell as its easiest on windows, just shift-right click where the files are and "open powershell here" then type in "python all.py", 
- **three.** Errors will happen as resouce packs don't always have all files, therefore it's an error(missing file). 
  - **three.five** this script is slow, for every json file it checks does a word exist in dictionary, that's slow af. 
- **four.** Technically that's it. 

- **But**, for sure some textures will not look right, it might be because pack format 4 introduces something that's not in third version or it also might be that the dictionary that i was using misses some blocks or items.


### currently working for sure resource packs:
 - RIKAI 0.5, only current bug is oak sapling block is not shown properly 
 
 ### rest
